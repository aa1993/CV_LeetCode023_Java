# 23. Merge k Sorted Lists
## Description

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

Constraints:

- `k == lists.length`
- `0 <= k <= 104`
- `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
- `$`-10^4`$ <= lists[i][j] <= $`10^4`$`
- `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
- The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed $`10^4`$.
